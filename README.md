## Book coverage (full product)

Coverage is not uniform. Here is what each book actually priced.

| Book | Quotes | Matches with a FT 1X2 close | From | Closing prices on |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| Bet365 | 59,584,092 | 45,497 (99.9 %) | 2016/17 | all 8 markets |
| Pinnacle | 5,284,952 | 34,004 (74.6 %) | 2018/19 | 1X2, Asian handicap, total goals |
| Unibet | 6,031,334 | 41,556 (91.2 %) | 2017/18 | 1X2, total goals |
| Betfair (Sportsbook) | 14,334,133 | 8,699 (19.1 %) | 2023/24 | 1X2 |
| Betsson | 2,144,963 | 17,226 (37.8 %) | 2022/23 | 1X2, total goals |

Split: **59,981,836 in-play** (68.6 %) · **27,397,638 pre-match** (31.4 %).

Markets: full-time 1X2, Asian handicap, total goals and total corners, and the same four for the
first half. Bookmakers are always named, never aggregated.

## Said plainly

Stated up front rather than discovered after paying.

- **Pinnacle starts in 2018/19, Betsson in 2022/23, Betfair** (Sportsbook, 1X2 only) **in 2023/24.**
  Coverage dips for Pinnacle in 2023/24 (69 %) and for Betfair in 2024/25 (24 %). The
  season-by-season table is in `sample/README.md`.
- **A closing quote is the last pre-match price recorded.** Median gap to kickoff on FT 1X2:
  Pinnacle 3 min, Betfair 6 min, Betsson 8 min, Bet365 24 min, Unibet 53 min. That is why every
  book has its own closing time.
- **Bet365 prices all 8 markets**, but its full-time corner market is regular only from 2019/20
  and its first-half handicap from 2020/21. Pinnacle in-play quotes are numerous only in 2026/27.
- **The first matchdays of 2016/17 are missing** (data starts 28 Aug 2016, 9 Sep for the
  Championship, Ligue 2 and 2. Bundesliga). Formations start in 2019/20, minute-by-minute stats
  are complete from 2020/21.
- **17 source events were removed** (postponed, abandoned, duplicated or reversed fixtures), each
  listed with its evidence in the README.
- **Odds are UTC and come from one provider.** No cross-provider reconciliation is claimed.

## What in-play looks like, in this sample

Elche 2-3 Real Madrid, La Liga, 15 September 2026. Bet365 full-time 1X2, in-play, around each
goal. Every row is in `sample/odds_timestamped/Big6_Odds_Timestamped_ESP_LL.csv.gz`.

| Timestamp (UTC) | Min | Score | Elche | Draw | Real Madrid |
|---|---:|---|---:|---:|---:|
| 2026-09-15T19:35:23Z | 3 | 0-0 | 12 | 7 | 1.181 |
| 2026-09-15T19:57:09Z | 25 | 0-1 | 29 | 12 | 1.055 |
| 2026-09-15T20:04:30Z | 32 | 0-1 | suspended | | |
| 2026-09-15T20:04:43Z | 32 | 0-2 | 51 | 23 | 1.015 |
| 2026-09-15T20:13:01Z | 41 | 0-3 | suspended | | |
| 2026-09-15T20:13:34Z | 41 | 0-2 | 51 | 23 | 1.015 |
| 2026-09-15T21:02:29Z | 70 | 1-2 | 41 | 9 | 1.071 |
| 2026-09-15T21:14:20Z | 82 | 2-2 | 12 | 1.909 | 2.2 |
| 2026-09-15T21:22:12Z | 90 | 2-2 | 17 | 1.25 | 4.75 |
| 2026-09-15T21:22:24Z | 90 | 2-3 | 251 | 13 | 1.035 |

At 41' the score reads 0-3 while the market is suspended, then goes back to 0-2 and the prices
reopen unchanged. Real Madrid's third goal only came at 90'. 216 in-play Bet365 1X2 quotes on
this match, and 1,914 Pinnacle quotes across its markets.

```python
import pandas as pd

o = pd.read_csv("sample/odds_timestamped/Big6_Odds_Timestamped_ESP_LL.csv.gz", dtype={"Match_ID": str})
live = o[(o.Match_ID == "13086922") & (o.Book == "Bet365") &
         (o.Market == "FT_1X2") & (o.Phase == "In-play")]
print(live[["Timestamp_UTC", "Minute", "Score_Home", "Score_Away",
            "Price_Home", "Price_Draw", "Price_Away", "Suspended"]].to_string())
```

## Seven tables, one key

Everything joins on `Match_ID`. No fuzzy name matching.

| File | One row per | Key content |
|---|---|---|
| `Big6_Matches.csv` / `.xlsx` | match | kickoff, season, stage, scores 90' / AET / penalties, formations, managers, referee, venue |
| `Big6_Opening_Closing_Odds.csv` / `.xlsx` | match | open and close per book and market, each with its time |
| `odds_timestamped/` (12 × `.csv.gz`) | price update | book, market, phase, prices, line, score, clock, suspension, UTC, epoch |
| `Big6_Team_Stats.csv` / `.xlsx` | match × team | 29 metrics incl. xG |
| `lineups/` (12 × `.csv.gz`) | player × match | starters, subs, shirt, position |
| `events/` (12 × `.csv.gz`) | event | 13 event types with minute and player |
| `minute_stats/` (12 × `.csv.gz`) | stat × minute | running stats minute by minute |

The complete column dictionary, the coverage tables and the integrity notes are in
`sample/README.md`, the README shipped with the product.

**Nothing a spreadsheet can reinterpret.** Scores, minutes and shoot-outs are separate integer
columns. Timestamps are full ISO 8601 with the T and the Z, plus an epoch. Formations are digits
(4231 = 4-2-3-1), so 4-4-2 never becomes 4 April 2002. Every cell was audited against Excel
auto-conversion patterns at write time, and every table was opened in LibreOffice in English and
French locales: zero conversions. A closing price is never an in-play price.
